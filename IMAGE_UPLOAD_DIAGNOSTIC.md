# Image Upload Diagnostic Report

## Current Implementation Analysis

### 1. Upload Flow
```
User selects image → Crop (4:3) → Upload to S3 → Store S3 key in DB → Display using signed URL
```

### 2. Files Involved
- `/app/api/upload/route.ts` - Handles file upload to S3
- `/lib/s3.ts` - S3 operations (upload, download, delete)
- `/lib/aws-config.ts` - AWS S3 client configuration
- `/lib/image-utils.ts` - Signed URL generation and caching
- `/components/s3-image.tsx` - Image display component

### 3. Current S3 Configuration
```
AWS_BUCKET_NAME=abacusai-apps-7d32bf3123d4c2cfa1f98696-us-west-2
AWS_FOLDER_PREFIX=1394/
AWS_REGION=us-west-2
AWS_PROFILE=hosted_storage
```

## Potential Issues

### Issue #1: Network/Permission Problems
**Symptoms:**
- Upload fails silently or returns 500 error
- S3 client cannot authenticate or access bucket

**Diagnosis Steps:**
1. Check S3 bucket permissions
2. Verify AWS credentials are valid
3. Test network connectivity to S3

**Solution:**
- AWS credentials are managed by the hosting platform
- S3 bucket access is pre-configured
- If uploads fail, contact platform support

### Issue #2: Large Image Files
**Symptoms:**
- Upload times out for large images
- Buffer allocation fails for very large files

**Current Mitigation:**
- File size limit was REMOVED (previously 5MB)
- This might cause memory issues

**Recommended Solution:**
- Re-implement reasonable file size limit (10-15MB)
- Add client-side image compression before upload
- Consider using multipart uploads for files > 5MB

### Issue #3: Mixed Data in Database
**Symptoms:**
- Some images load, others don't
- Old images show as broken

**Root Cause:**
- Database contains mix of:
  - Full S3 signed URLs (expire after 24 hours)
  - S3 keys without folder prefix
  - S3 keys with folder prefix

**Solution Implemented:**
- Smart key detection in `downloadFile()` function
- Automatic prefix addition when needed
- HeadObjectCommand to verify object existence

### Issue #4: Signed URL Expiration
**Symptoms:**
- Images work initially, then break after 24 hours

**Current Mitigation:**
- Signed URLs cached for 12 hours
- Automatic regeneration on cache miss
- URLs valid for 24 hours

**Note:**
- This is by design - S3 presigned URLs expire
- Frontend requests new signed URL when needed

## Recommended Sustainable Solutions

### Option 1: CloudFront CDN (BEST - But requires platform support)
**Benefits:**
- No signed URLs needed
- Public image access through CDN
- Better performance globally
- Lower S3 costs

**Implementation:**
- Configure CloudFront distribution for S3 bucket
- Use CloudFront URLs instead of signed URLs
- Set appropriate cache headers

**Limitations:**
- Requires platform infrastructure changes
- May not be available on current hosting

### Option 2: Server-Side Proxy (Current approach)
**Benefits:**
- Works with current infrastructure
- Maintains privacy controls
- No infrastructure changes needed

**Implementation:**
- Current approach (generating signed URLs)
- Cache signed URLs client-side (LocalStorage/SessionStorage)
- Automatic regeneration on expiry

**Limitations:**
- Extra server load
- 24-hour URL expiration
- More S3 API calls

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach (RECOMMENDED)
**Benefits:**
- Public images served via CloudFront (if available)
- Private images use signed URLs
- Best of both worlds

**Implementation:**
1. Check if CloudFront is available
2. Use CloudFront for public project images
3. Use signed URLs for private/draft content

## Testing Commands

### Test S3 Connection
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/debug/s3-test
```

### Check Existing Images
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/debug/check-images
```

### Test Upload
```bash
# Create a test image
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/upload \
  -F "file=@test-image.jpg" \
  -H "Cookie: next-auth.session-token=YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN"
```

## Database Cleanup (If needed)

If database contains expired signed URLs, run this migration:

```sql
-- This would need to be a one-time migration
-- to convert old signed URLs to S3 keys
-- NOT RECOMMENDED - only if absolutely necessary
```

## Monitoring

Add these metrics to track image upload health:
1. Upload success rate
2. Average upload time
3. S3 errors per hour
4. Signed URL cache hit rate

## Conclusion

The current implementation should work reliably for most use cases. 
The main limitation is that signed URLs expire after 24 hours, but 
this is handled automatically by the frontend requesting new URLs.

If images are still failing to upload:
1. Check browser console for specific error messages
2. Check server logs for S3 errors
3. Verify AWS credentials are valid
4. Test with small images (< 1MB) first
5. Check network connectivity to S3

**Most likely cause of current issues:**
- AWS credentials expired/invalid
- S3 bucket permissions changed
- Network connectivity issues
- Platform infrastructure problems

**Contact platform support if:**
- Uploads consistently fail with 500 errors
- S3 authentication errors in logs
- CloudFront distribution is needed
